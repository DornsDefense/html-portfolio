                <p>In these books you finally reach the culmination of all of the authors hard work
                setting up the finale. You get to see the toll that months of endless war has raged on all of the heroes
                in the series. It defintely worth all of the time it takes to read everything necesarry to get to this book</p>

                />
                <p>This book makes it way onto my list because of the epic duel between Jaghatai Khan, Primarch of the White Scars and Mortarion, Primarch of the Death Guard. No more is needed to be said other than the duel is everything you expected and then some.</p>

                <p>Once again a book is making it onto this list beacuse of a much promised epic duel. This time between Sanguinius, Primarch of the Blood angels
                and Angron, Primarch of the World Eaters. You also get to see the struggle and fear brought onto the rest of Terra from the war.</p>
